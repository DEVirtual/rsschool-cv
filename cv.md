## About Me

My name is Dmitry, I am 35 years old. I have a higher technical education.

In recent years, I have been providing services in the field of information technology and engineering. I provide assistance in the administration and support of websites, deployment and configuration of CMS. I also do engineering and calculation work, processing and structuring information, writing technical articles and manuals.

I help students in writing diploma and course projects in the field of IT.

At the moment I am studying RS School JavaScript/Front-end course.

I am sure that this technical background and relevant work experience, as well as interest and desire for professional development in the field of Front-end development, will be a good starting point for entering this profession.
